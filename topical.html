                <p>This page contains two short texts which discuss the interplay between technology and society. The first text mentions some political consequences that technology and in particular social media and online news brings along. The second text tries to give an answer to the statement that "the person who invented the train, also invented the train crash". If you want to read more about these topics, we have provided links at the bottom of the page which lead you to external sites containing relevant information. In case you are hungry or want a cup of coffee, we recommend clicking the button on the very top of the page. </p>

            <h2 class="heading">Technology and Political Consequences</h2>

            <p>Technology can have a great impact on the political landscape. 
                The last decade social media has grown massively, 
                according to <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/social-media-marketing/social-media-strategy/new-global-social-media-research/">Chaffey (2022)</a>, it is so large that 59 percent 
                of the world's population are now using it daily. 
                There lies an opportunity for political parties to broadcast to 
                a wider spectrum of people.
            </p>

            <p>Some news outlets have a clear agenda when it 
                comes to which political side they are on. 
                This has become more prevalent in the last two decades. 
                According to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-athletes-way/201905/how-has-news-changed-over-the-past-30-years">Psychology Today (2019)</a>, news is presented 
                in a more subjective manner than before. The number 
                of news outlets has also increased.
            </p>
            <p>There is so much information, when it comes to politics, 
                you have to be critical to the sources you follow. 
                You should make sure that the sources are legitimate.
                It is also important to keep in mind which political party 
                the news outlet is associated with, as this can impact the way 
                a story is framed.
            </p>
            <p>A downside of this is the echo-chambers that get created on 
                the different platforms. People only get a specific type of content, 
                from a specific political viewpoint, something which often leads 
                to extreme thoughts to arise. These extreme thoughts often go unchecked, 
                as people tend to only communicate with others who hold the same viewpoint.</p>

            <h2 class="heading">The Person Who Invented the Train, Also Invented the Train Crash</h2>

            <p>“The person who invented the train, also invented the train crash”. 
                This statement is difficult to determine to what extent it is true. 
                Without the invention of trains, there obviously would not be any train crashes, 
                but in return, people would still be riding on horses to move around. 
                In this case, we would say the convenience and economic growth the 
                invention of the train has brought with it outweighs the negative aspects of it.</p>

            <p>Ethical questions are always difficult to answer, sometimes there is no right or wrong answer. 
                What is the greater good? What will ultimately save more lives in the end? 
                Do the positive outcomes of the innovation outweigh the negative outcomes? 
                These are questions one should ask oneself. There will inevitably be sacrifices 
                that need to be made in order to introduce new technology, and these sacrifices 
                should be thoroughly evaluated wether or not they are worth making. </p>
            <p>The inventor should take potential consequences of their invention into 
                consideration before it is released to the public. If it could be harmful in any way, 
                the potential dangers should be limited as much as possible. Examples of such security 
                measures for innovations, are <a href="https://www.defensivedriving.com/blog/a-history-of-seat-belts/">seat belts</a> in vehicles and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(firearms)">safety lever on firearms</a>. 
                There will always be deaths related to vehicles and guns, but the implementation of 
                these security measures has certainly reduced the number of people killed.</p>
